Example Input/Output 1:

Input:

1232

Output:

1122233

Explanation:

The digit 1 has 2 after it. So 1 is repeated two times.

The digit 2 has the digit 3 after it. So 2 is repeated 3 times. The digit 3 has the digit 2 before it. So 3 is repeated 2 times. The fourth digit 2 does not have any digit after it and hence is ignored
